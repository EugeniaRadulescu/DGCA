Package: DGCA
Title: Differential Gene Correlation Analysis
Description: Differential correlation analysis on input
    matrices, with multiple conditions specified by a design matrix. Contains
    functions to filter, process, save, visualize, and interpret differential
    correlations of identifier-pairs across the entire identifier space, or with
    respect to a particular set of identifiers (e.g., one). Although the package
    was built with gene expression data in mind, it is applicable to other types of
    genomics data as well, in addition to being potentially applicable to data from other fields
    entirely.
